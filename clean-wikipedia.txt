gaius julius caesar sizr latin ais julis kaesar  july  bc   march  bc was a roman general and statesman a member of the first triumvirate caesar led the roman armies in the gallic wars before defeating his political rival pompey in a civil war and subsequently became dictator from  bc until his assassination in  bc he played a critical role in the events that led to the demise of the roman republic and the rise of the roman empire
in  bc caesar crassus and pompey formed the first triumvirate an informal political alliance that dominated roman politics for several years their attempts to amass political power were opposed by many in the senate among them cato the younger with the private support of cicero caesar rose to become one of the most powerful politicians in the roman republic through a string of military victories in the gallic wars completed by  bc which greatly extended roman territory during this time he both invaded britain and built a bridge across the rhine river these achievements and the support of his veteran army threatened to eclipse the standing of pompey who had realigned himself with the senate after the death of crassus in  bc with the gallic wars concluded the senate ordered caesar to step down from his military command and return to rome in  bc caesar openly defied the senates authority by crossing the rubicon and marching towards rome at the head of an army this began caesars civil war which he won leaving him in a position of nearunchallenged power and influence in  bc
after assuming control of government caesar began a program of social and governmental reforms including the creation of the julian calendar he gave citizenship to many residents of far regions of the roman republic he initiated land reform and support for veterans he centralized the bureaucracy of the republic and was eventually proclaimed dictator for life dictator perpetuo his populist and authoritarian reforms angered the elites who began to conspire against him on the ides of march  march  bc caesar was assassinated by a group of rebellious senators led by brutus and cassius who stabbed him to death a new series of civil wars broke out and the constitutional government of the republic was never fully restored caesars greatnephew and adopted heir octavian later known as augustus rose to sole power after defeating his opponents in the last civil war of the roman republic octavian set about solidifying his power and the era of the roman empire began
caesar was an accomplished author and historian as well as a statesman much of his life is known from his own accounts of his military campaigns other contemporary sources include the letters and speeches of cicero and the historical writings of sallust later biographies of caesar by suetonius and plutarch are also important sources caesar is considered by many historians to be one of the greatest military commanders in history his cognomen was subsequently adopted as a synonym for emperor the title caesar was used throughout the roman empire giving rise to modern descendants such as kaiser and tsar he has frequently appeared in literary and artistic works and his political philosophy known as caesarism has inspired politicians into the modern era
gaius julius caesar was born into a patrician family the gens julia on  july  bc the family claimed to have immigrated to rome from alba longa during the seventh century bc after the third king of rome tullus hostilius took and destroyed their city the family also claimed descent from julus the son of aeneas and founder of alba longa given that aeneas was a son of venus this made the clan divine this genealogy had not yet been taken its final form by the first century but the clans claimed descent from venus was more well established in public consciousness there is no evidence that caesar himself was born by caesarian section such operations entailed the death of the mother but caesars mother lived for decades after his birth and no ancient sources record any difficulty with the birth
despite their ancient pedigree the julii caesares were not especially politically influential during the middle republic the first person known to have had the cognomen caesar was a praetor in  bc during the second punic war the familys first consul was in  bc though their political fortunes had recovered in the early first century producing two consuls in  and  bc caesars homonymous father was moderately successful politically he married aurelia a member of the politically influential aurelii cottae producing  along with caesar  two daughters buoyed by his own marriage and his sisters marriage the dictators aunt with the extremely influential gaius marius he also served on the saturninian land commission in  bc and was elected praetor some time between  and  bc he served as proconsular governor of asia for two years likely  bc
caesars father did not seek a consulship during the domination of lucius cornelius cinna and instead chose retirement during cinnas dominance caesar was named as flamen dialis a priest of jupiter which led to his marriage to cinnas daughter cornelia the religious taboos of the priesthood would have forced caesar to forego a political career the appointment  one of the highest nonpolitical honours  indicates that there were few expectations of a major career for caesar in early  bc caesars father died suddenly after sullas victory in the civil war  bc cinnas acta were annulled sulla consequently ordered caesar to abdicate and divorce cinnas daughter caesar refused implicitly questioning the legitimacy of sullas annulment sulla may have put caesar on the proscription lists though scholars are mixed caesar then went into hiding before his relatives and contacts among the vestal virgins were able to intercede on his behalf they then reached a compromise where caesar would resign his priesthood but keep his wife and chattels sullas alleged remark he saw in caesar many mariuses is apocryphal
bust from the imperial period of a man  in this case augustus  wearing the civic crown latin corona civica caesar won the civic crown for his bravery at the siege of mytilene in  bc
caesar then left italy to serve in the staff of the governor of asia marcus minucius thermus while there he travelled to bithynia to collect naval reinforcements he stayed some time as a guest of the king nicomedes iv though later invective connected caesar to a homosexual relation with the monarch he then served at the siege of mytilene where he won the civic crown for saving the life of a fellow citizen in battle the privileges of the crown  the senate was supposed to stand on a holders entrance and holders were permitted to wear the crown at public occasions  whetted caesars appetite for honours after the capture of the mytilene caesar transferred to the staff of publius servilius vatia in cilicia before learning of sullas death in  bc and returning home immediately he was alleged to have wanted to join in on the consul lepidus revolt that year but this is likely literary embellishment of caesars desire for tyranny from a young age
afterward caesar attacked some of the sullan aristocracy in the courts but was unsuccessful in his attempted prosecution of gnaeus cornelius dolabella in  bc who had recently returned from a proconsulship in macedonia going after a less wellconnected senator he was successful the next year in prosecuting gaius antonius hybrida later consul in  bc for profiteering from the proscriptions but was forestalled when a tribune interceded on antonius behalf after these oratorical attempts caesar left rome for rhodes seeking the tutelage of the rhetorician apollonius molon while travelling he was intercepted and ransomed by pirates in a story that was later much embellished according to plutarch and suetonius he was freed after paying a ransom of fifty talents and responded by returning with a fleet to capture and execute the pirates the recorded sum for the ransom is literary embellishment and it is more likely that the pirates were sold into slavery per velleius paterculus his studies were interrupted by the outbreak of the third mithridatic war over the winter of  and  bc caesar is alleged to have gone around collecting troops in the province at the locals expense and leading them successfully against mithridates forces
while absent from rome in  bc caesar was coopted into the pontifices in place of his deceased relative gaius aurelius cotta the promotion marked him as a wellaccepted member of the aristocracy with great future prospects in his political career caesar decided to return shortly thereafter and on his return was elected one of the military tribunes for  bc there is no evidence that caesar served in war  even though the war on spartacus was ongoing  during his term he did however agitate for the removal of the sullas disabilities on the plebeian tribunate and for those who supported lepidus revolt to be pardoned these advocacies were common and uncontroversial the next year  bc pompey and crassus were consuls and brought legislation restoring the plebeian tribunates rights one of the tribunes with caesar supporting then brought legislation pardoning the lepidan exiles
for his quaestorship in  bc caesar was allotted to serve under gaius antistius vetus in hispania ulterior his election also gave him a lifetime seat in the senate however before he left his aunt julia the widow of marius died soon afterwards his wife cornelia died shortly after bearing his only legitimate child julia he gave eulogies for both at public funerals during julias funeral caesar displayed the images of his aunts husband marius whose memory had been suppressed after sullas victory in the civil war some of the sullan nobles  including quintus lutatius catulus  who had suffered under the marian regime objected but by this point depictions of husbands in aristocratic womens funerary processions was common contra plutarch caesars action here was likely in keeping with a political trend for reconciliation and normalisation rather than a display of renewed factionalism caesar quickly remarried taking the hand of sullas granddaughter pompeia
for much of this period caesar was one of pompeys supporters caesar joined with pompey in the late s to support restoration of tribunician rights his support for the law recalling the lepidan exiles may have been related to the same tribunes bill to grant lands to pompeys veterans caesar also supported the lex gabinia in  bc granting pompey an extraordinary command against piracy in the mediterranean and also supported the lex manilia in  bc to reassign the third mithridatic war from its thencommander lucullus to pompey
four years after his aunt julias funeral in  bc caesar served as curule aedile and staged lavish games that won him further attention and popular support he also restored the trophies won by marius and taken down by sulla over jugurtha and the cimbri according to plutarchs narrative the trophies were restored overnight to the applause and tears of joy of the onlookers any sudden and secret restoration of this sort would not have been possible  architects restorers and other workmen would have to have been hired and paid for  nor would it have been likely that the work could have been done in a single night it is more likely that caesar was merely restoring his familys public monuments  consistent with standard aristocratic practice and the virtue of pietas  and over objections from catulus these actions were broadly supported by the senate
in  bc caesar stood for the praetorship and also for the post of pontifex maximus who was the head of the college of pontiffs and the highest ranking state religious official in the pontifical election before the tribes caesar faced two influential senators quintus lutatius catulus and publius servilius isauricus caesar came out victorious many scholars have expressed astonishment that caesars candidacy was taken seriously but this was not without historical precedent ancient sources allege that caesar paid huge bribes or was shamelessly ingratiating that no charge was ever laid alleging this implies that bribery alone is insufficient to explain his victory if bribes or other monies were needed they may have been underwritten by pompey whom caesar at this time supported and who opposed catulus candidacy
many sources also assert that caesar supported the land reform proposals brought that year by plebeian tribune publius servilius rullus however there are no ancient sources so attesting caesar also engaged in a collateral manner in the trial of gaius rabirius by one of the plebeian tribunes  titus labienus  for the murder of saturninus in accordance with a senatus consultum ultimum some forty years earlier the most famous event of the year was the catilinarian conspiracy while some of caesars enemies including catulus alleged that he participated in the conspiracy the chance that he was a participant is extremely small
caesar won his election to the praetorship in  bc easily and as one of the praetorelects spoke out that december in the senate against executing certain citizens who had been arrested in the city conspiring with gauls in furtherance of the conspiracy caesars proposal at the time is not entirely clear the earlier sources assert that he advocated life imprisonment without trial the later sources assert he instead wanted the conspirators imprisoned pending trial most accounts agree that caesar supported confiscation of the conspirators property caesar likely advocated the former which was a compromise position that would place the senate within the bounds of the lex sempronia de capite civis and was initially successful in swaying the body a later intervention by cato however swayed the senate at the end for execution
during his year as praetor caesar first attempted to deprive his enemy catulus of the honour of completing the rebuilt temple of jupiter optimus maximus accusing him of embezzling funds and threatening to bring legislation to reassign it to pompey this proposal was quickly dropped amid nearuniversal opposition he then supported the attempt by plebeian tribune metellus nepos to transfer the command against catiline from the consul of  gaius antonius hybrida to pompey after a violent meeting of the comitia tributa in the forum where metellus came into fisticuffs with his tribunician colleagues cato and quintus minucius thermus the senate passed a decree against metellus  suetonius claims that both nepos and caesar were deposed from their magistracies this would have been a constitutional impossibility  which led caesar to distance himself from the proposals hopes for a provincial command and need to repair relations with the aristocracy took priority he also was engaged in the bona dea affair where publius clodius pulcher snuck into caesars house sacrilegiously during a female religious observance caesar avoided any part of the affair by divorcing his wife immediately  claiming that his wife needed to be above suspicion  but there is no indication that caesar supported clodius in any way
after the elections caesar reconciled pompey and crassus two political foes in a threeway alliance misleadingly termed the first triumvirate in modern times caesar was still at work in december of  bc attempting to find allies for his consulship and the alliance was finalised only some time around its start pompey and crassus joined in pursuit of two respective goals the ratification of pompeys eastern conquests and the bailing out of tax farmers in asia many of whom were crassus clients all three sought the extended patronage of land grants with pompey especially seeking the promised land grants for his veterans
caesars first act was to publish the minutes of the senate and the assemblies signalling the senates accountability to the public he then brought in the senate a bill  crafted to avoid objections to previous land reform proposals and any indications of radicalism  to purchase property from willing sellers to distribute to pompeys veterans and the urban poor it would be administered by a board of twenty caesar would be excluded and financed by pompeys plunder and territorial gains referring it to the senate in hopes that it would take up the matter to show its beneficence for the people there was little opposition and the obstructionism that occurred was largely unprincipled firmly opposing it not on grounds of public interest but rather opposition to caesars political advancement unable to overcome catos filibustering he moved the bill before the people at a public meeting caesars coconsul bibulus threatened a permanent veto for the entire year this clearly violated the peoples wellestablished legislative sovereignty and triggered a riot in which his fasces were broken symbolising popular rejection of his magistracy the bill was then voted through bibulus attempted to induce the senate to nullify it on grounds it was passed by violence and contrary to the auspices the senate refused
caesar also brought and passed a onethird writedown of tax farmers arrears for crassus and ratification of pompeys eastern settlements both bills were passed with little or no debate in the senate caesar then moved to lift the extend his agrarian bill to campania some time in may this may be when bibulus withdrew to his house pompey shortly thereafter also wed caesars daughter julia to seal their alliance an ally of caesars plebeian tribune publius vatinius moved the lex vatinia assigning the provinces of illyricum and cisalpine gaul to caesar for five years suetonius claim that the senate had assigned to caesar the silvae callesque woods and tracks is likely an exaggeration fear of gallic invasion had grown in  bc and it is more likely that the consuls had been assigned to italy and that caesarian partisans dismissed this defensive posture as mere forest tracks the senate was also persuaded to assign to caesar the transalpine gaul as well subject to annual renewal likely to control his ability to make war on the far side of the alps
some time in the year perhaps after the passage of bill distributing the campanian land after these political defeats bibulus to withdrew to his house to issue edicts in absentia purporting unprecedentedly to cancel all days on which caesar or his allies could hold votes for religious reasons cato too attempted symbolic gestures against it which allowed him and his allies allowing them to feign victimisation these tactics were successful in building revulsion to caesar and his allies through the year this opposition caused serious political difficulties to caesar and his allies belying the common depiction of triumviral political supremacy when his consulship ended caesars legislation was challenged by two of the new praetors but discussion in the senate stalled and was regardless dropped he stayed near the city until some time around midmarch
during the gallic wars caesar wrote his commentaries thereon which were acknowledged even in his time as a latin literary masterwork meant to document caesars campaigns in his own words and maintain support in rome for his military operations and career he produced some ten volumes covering operations in gaul from  bc each was likely produced in the year following the events described and was likely aimed at the general or at least literate population in rome the account is naturally partial to caesar  his defeats are excused and victories highlighted  but it is almost the sole source for events in gaul in this period
gaul in  bc was in the midst of some instability tribes had raided into transalpine gaul and there was an ongoing struggle between two tribes in central gaul which collaterally involved roman alliances and politics the divisions within the gauls  they were no unified bloc  would be exploited in the coming years the first engagement was in april  bc when caesar met the migrating helvetii from moving through roman territory allegedly because he feared they would unseat a roman ally building a wall he stopped their movement near geneva and  after raising two legions  defeated them in at the battle of bibracte before forcing them to return to their original homes he was drawn further north responding to requests of gallic tribes including the aedui for aid against ariovistus  king of the suebi and a declared friend of rome by the senate during caesars own consulship  and he defeated them at the battle of vosges wintering in northeastern gaul near the belgae in the winter of  caesars forward military position triggered an uprising to remove his troops able to eke out a victory at the battle of the sabis caesar spent much of  bc suppressing the belgae and dispersing his troops to campaign across much of gaul including against the veneti in what is now brittany at this point almost all of gaul  except its central regions  falling under roman subjugation
seeking to buttress his military reputation he engaged germans attempting to cross the rhine which marked it as a roman frontier displaying roman engineering prowess he here built a bridge across the rhine in a feat of engineering meant to show romes ability to project power ostensibly seeking to interdict british aid to his gallic enemies he led expeditions into southern britain in  and  bc perhaps seeking further conquests or otherwise wanting to impress readers in rome britain at the time was to the romans an island of mystery and a land of wonder he however withdrew from the island in the face of winter uprisings in gaul led by the eburones and belgae starting in late  bc which ambushed and virtually annihilated a legion and five cohorts caesar was however able to lure the rebels into unfavourable terrain and routed them in battle the next year a greater challenge emerged with the uprising of most of central gaul led by vercingetorix of the averni caesar was initially defeated at gergovia before besieging vercingetorix at alesia after becoming himself besieged caesar won a major victory which forced vercingertorixs surrender caesar then spent much of his time into  bc suppressing any remaining resistance
n the initial years from the end of caesars consulship in  bc the three socalled triumvirs sought to maintain the goodwill of the extremely popular publius clodius pulcher who was plebeian tribune in  bc and in that year successfully sent cicero into exile when clodius took an antipompeian stance later that year he unsettled pompeys eastern arrangements started attacking the validity of caesars consular legislation and by august  forced pompey into seclusion caesar and pompey responded by successfully backing the election of magistrates to recall cicero from exile on the condition that cicero would refrain from criticism or obstruction of the allies
with politics in rome falling into violent street clashes between clodius and two tribunes who were friends of cicero now supporting the allies caesar sent to rome news of his victories in gaul along with the claim of total victory and pacification the senate at ciceros motion voted him an unprecedented fifteen days of thanksgiving such reports were necessary for caesar especially in light of senatorial opponents to prevent the senate from reassigning his command in transalpine gaul even if his position in cisalpine gaul and illyricum was guaranteed by the lex vatinia until  bc his success was evidently recognised when the senate voted state funds for some of caesars legions which until this time caesar paid for personally
the three allies relations broke down in  bc one of pompeys allies challenged caesars land reform bill and the allies had a poor showing in the elections that year with a real threat to caesars command and acta brewing in  bc under the aegis of the unfriendly consuls caesar needed his allies political support pompey and crassus too wanted military commands they pooled their political resources again drawing in the support of appius claudius pulcher and his younger brother clodius for the consulship of  bc they planned second consulships with following governorships in  bc for both pompey and crassus along with a five year extension of caesars command
cicero was inducted to oppose reassignment of caesars provinces and to defend a number of the allies clients his gloomy predictions of a triumviral set consulsdesignate for years on end proved an exaggeration when only by desperate tactics bribery intimidation and violence were pompey and crassus elected consuls for  bc during their consulship pompey and crassus passed  with some tribunician support  the lex pompeia licinia extending caesars command and the lex trebonia giving them respective commands in spain and syria though pompey never left for the province and remained politically active at rome the opposition again unified against their heavyhanded political tactics  though not against caesars activities in gaul  and defeated the allies in the elections of that year
the ambush and destruction in gaul of a legion and five cohorts in the winter of  bc produced substantial concern in rome about caesars command and competence evidenced by the highly defensive narrative in caesars commentaries the death of caesars daughter and pompeys wife julia in childbirth clate august  did not create a rift between caesar and pompey at the start of  bc caesar sought and received reinforcements by recruitment and a private deal with pompey before two years of largely unsuccessful campaigning against gallic insurgents when in  bc pompey started the year with a sole consulship to restore order to the city caesar was in gaul suppressing insurgencies after news of his victory at alesia with the support of pompey he received twenty days of thanksgiving and pursuant to the law of the ten tribunes the right to stand for the consulship in absentia
